 Total renewable energy purchased includes self-supply renewable energy where Wells Fargo generates renewable energy from on-site solar installations, power purchase agreements, which are contracts for the purchase of power and 
associated Renewable Energy Certificates, as well as Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates, which are sold, delivered, or purchased separately from the electricity generated from the renewable resource.
21
 Wells Fargo secures enough Renewable Energy Certificates to meet or exceed our annual consumption of purchased electricity. 
22
 New sources of renewable energy are defined as assets where commercial operation was achieved no earlier than 12 months prior to contract execution. This data includes cumulative new renewable energy generation capacity contracted 
by Wells Fargo. Some assets have not yet achieved commercial operation and are under construction.

1
 MTCO2e stands for metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. 
2
 A location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs (using grid average emission factor data). A market-based 
method reflects emissions from electricity that Wells Fargo has purposefully chosen. It derives emission factors from contractual instruments, which include any type of 
contract between two parties for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled attribute claims.
3
 In 2022, Wells Fargo purchased carbon offsets from projects that remove and store carbon. A portion of these credits are Verified Carbon Standard (VSC) certified and 
have also achieved the add-on Climate, Community and Biodiversity (CCB) certification and are therefore VSC+CCB certified. The remaining portion is certified by the 
Climate Action Reserve (CAR).
4
 As part of its journey toward net zero, Wells Fargo has implemented carbon reduction strategies and purchased energy attribute certificates and carbon offsets sufficient 
to cover its total Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions for 2022.
