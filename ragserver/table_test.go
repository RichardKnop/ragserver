 Total renewable energy purchased includes self-supply renewable energy where Wells Fargo generates renewable energy from on-site solar installations, power purchase agreements, which are contracts for the purchase of power and 
associated Renewable Energy Certificates, as well as Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates, which are sold, delivered, or purchased separately from the electricity generated from the renewable resource.
21
 Wells Fargo secures enough Renewable Energy Certificates to meet or exceed our annual consumption of purchased electricity. 
22
 New sources of renewable energy are defined as assets where commercial operation was achieved no earlier than 12 months prior to contract execution. This data includes cumulative new renewable energy generation capacity contracted 
by Wells Fargo. Some assets have not yet achieved commercial operation and are under construction.
